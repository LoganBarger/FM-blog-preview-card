## My process

For this project, my goal is to utilize Bootstrap for the majority of the styling. I aim to evaluate how much faster and simpler it is compared to using custom CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap 5

### What I learned

I discovered that I enjoy using Bootstrap for styling because it significantly accelerates the styling process by leveraging the built-in styles provided by Bootstrap.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - Utilizing Bootstrap necessitated a strong understanding of Bootstrap property syntax. I frequently referenced the Bootstrap documentation to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
- [Github commit message conventions](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13) - After completing my first project, I realized that my commit messages might not be sufficient for a larger, evolving project. I found the conventions outlined in this cheatsheet to be very helpful and plan to adopt them for all future projects.
